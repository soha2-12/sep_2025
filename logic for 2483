What the question is asking

You are given a string of hours made of Y (customer comes) and N (no customer).

You must choose one hour to close the shop.

Your goal is to minimize penalty, not maximize profit.

How penalty works

Shop open + no customer (N) → penalty +1

Shop closed + customer (Y) → penalty +1

Choose the closing hour that gives the least total penalty.

Key observation

Every hour contributes either before closing or after closing — never both.

So instead of checking every hour separately (slow), we slide the closing time once.

Core logic (step-by-step)

Start with the shop closed all day

Penalty = total number of Y (all customers missed).

Move closing time hour by hour from left to right.

At each hour:

If it’s Y → you now serve that customer → penalty − 1

If it’s N → shop was open unnecessarily → penalty + 1

Keep tracking the minimum penalty seen so far.

The hour where penalty is minimum is the best closing time.

Why this is efficient

Only one pass through the string.

No nested loops, no extra arrays.

Time complexity: O(n)

Space complexity: O(1)
