A horizontal trapezoid needs two horizontal parallel sides.

This happens only when:

You pick two points on one horizontal line (same y),

And two points on another horizontal line (different y).

So the problem becomes:

Count how many points lie on each horizontal y-coordinate.

For each y-level with k points, you can form
C(k, 2) horizontal segments.

A trapezoid is formed by choosing:

one horizontal segment from some y₁, and

one horizontal segment from a different y₂.

So the final answer is:

For every pair of y-levels:
multiply the number of segments on y₁ with the number on y₂
and add them up.

That gives the total number of horizontal trapezoids.
