You are given a list of stock prices, where each number represents the price of a stock on a particular day. Your task is to count how many smooth descent periods exist in this price history.

A smooth descent period is a group of consecutive days that follows one simple rule:
starting from the second day of the period, the price must drop by exactly 1 compared to the previous day. The first day of the period has no restriction.

An important point is that a single day by itself always counts as a smooth descent period. Even if the price goes up or stays the same afterward, that one day is still valid.

What you are really doing is examining every possible continuous segment of the price list and checking whether it forms a perfect step-by-step downward pattern, decreasing by one each day.

For example:

[7] is valid (single day).

[7,6] is valid because the price drops by exactly 1.

[7,6,5] is also valid for the same reason.

[7,5] is not valid because the drop is 2, not 1.

[7,6,4] is not valid because the pattern breaks.

[7,8] is not valid because the price increases.

The challenge is not just to spot one descent, but to count all possible descent periods, including shorter ones that are part of longer sequences. For instance, in [5,4,3], you don’t just count the full three-day period—you also count [5], [4], [3], [5,4], and [4,3].

So the problem is about recognizing consistent, exact downward steps in a sequence and counting every continuous way those steps can form valid periods.
