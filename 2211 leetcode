Cars at the very left going left ('L') will never meet anyone, so ignore them.

Cars at the very right going right ('R') will also never meet anyone, so ignore them.

Any car that is not in those ignored edges will eventually collide if it is moving.

In the remaining middle part:

Every 'L' or 'R' will end up hitting someone or something.

Only 'S' (stationary) doesn’t add collisions itself.
