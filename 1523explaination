The idea is to count odd numbers without checking each number.

Odd numbers appear in a perfect pattern:
1, 3, 5, 7…
every second number is odd.

So instead of scanning the entire range, we do something smarter:

1. Count how many odd numbers exist from 0 up to high.

This gives the total number of odds that appear before or at the upper limit.

2. Count how many odd numbers exist from 0 up to low - 1.

This tells how many odds already passed before the range starts.

3. Subtract the two counts.

This removes the odds before low, leaving only the ones between low and high (inclusive).
