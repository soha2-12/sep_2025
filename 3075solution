Penalty increases with each pick
Every time you pick a child, future picks become less valuable. So order matters a lot.

Greedy thinking applies
Since earlier picks suffer less penalty, you want the largest happiness values to be used earliest.

Sort happiness in descending order
This ensures:

The happiest child gets picked when penalty is 0

The next happiest when penalty is 1

And so on…

Apply the penalty while picking
For the i-th child picked:

Effective happiness = original happiness − i

Ignore negative results
If the penalty makes happiness ≤ 0, adding it would reduce the total, so you treat it as 0.
