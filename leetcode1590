LeetCode 1590 asks you to remove the smallest subarray so the remaining sum is divisible by p. First compute need = total % p. If it's zero, return 0. Otherwise, you must remove a subarray whose sum has remainder need. Using prefix sums modulo p, you track each prefix remainder in a dictionary. For each index, compute the current prefix modulo and check if a previous prefix has the value needed to form a valid removable subarray. The difference of indices gives the subarray length. Keep the minimum. If it equals the entire array, return -1.
