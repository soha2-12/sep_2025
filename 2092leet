What the problem is really saying

There are n people.
Person 0 knows a secret and tells it to firstPerson at time 0.

After that, people meet each other at specific times.
If anyone in a meeting already knows the secret at that exact time, the secret is shared with the other person immediately.

Important detail:
If someone receives the secret at a time, they can pass it on in other meetings happening at the same time.

The main challenge

The tricky part is time.

You cannot let the secret spread:

backward in time

or across meetings that happen at different times

So sharing must happen:

only among people connected by meetings at the same time

and only if at least one of them already knows the secret

How the solution thinks about it

Sort all meetings by time
This lets us process events in the exact order they happen.

Handle one time block at a time
If several meetings happen at the same time, treat them as one group.

Inside one time block

Imagine a temporary network of people meeting at that moment.

Only people who already know the secret can start spreading it.

The secret spreads freely inside this group because sharing is instantaneous.

After finishing that time

Everyone who learned the secret in that block keeps it forever.

The temporary network is discarded.

We move on to the next time.

Repeat until all meetings are processed

Why this works

It respects time order

It allows instant sharing at the same time

It prevents leaks across unrelated meetings

It correctly handles chains like:

someone gets the secret → immediately passes it on → in another meeting at the same time
