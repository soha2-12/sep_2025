We look at the strings column by column instead of row by row.
For each column, we compare the characters from the first string to the last string.
If at any point the order breaks (a character comes before a smaller one alphabetically), that column cannot be kept.
So we mark it for deletion and move to the next column.
Finally, we return the number of columns that were not sorted
