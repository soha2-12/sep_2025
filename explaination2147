Imagine you’re walking down a long hallway.

In this hallway, there are only:

chairs (S)

plants (P)

There’s already a wall at the start and a wall at the end.
You’re allowed to add more walls anywhere between two spots.

Your job is to make rooms.

But there’s one strict rule:

👉 Every room must have exactly TWO chairs.
Not one. Not three. Exactly two.

Plants don’t matter. They’re just decoration.

First reality check

If the hallway has:

no chairs, or

an odd number of chairs

then stop right there.

There’s no way to split it correctly.

Why?
Because chairs must come in pairs.
One lonely chair = one broken room.

Now assume the chairs pair up nicely

You start walking from left to right.

The moment you see two chairs, that’s a ** room.

Those two chairs belong together. They’re done.

The next chair you see must belong to the next room.

So the hallway naturally forms chunks of two chairs.

So where does “multiple ways” come from?

This is where the plants matter.

Between two chair-pairs, there might be plants.

Example:

(chair chair) plant plant plant (chair chair)


Those plants are empty space.

You can put the wall:

right after the chairs

after the first plant

after the second plant

after the third plant

Every one of those choices creates a different valid layout.

More plants = more freedom.

No plants?

Then there’s only one obvious place to put the wall.
