Imagine a city laid out like a giant n × n grid.

Some squares on this grid have buildings on them.
Each building has coordinates like (x, y).

Now a building is called covered if it is not lonely — it must have neighbors in all four straight directions:

✔ Left

Another building somewhere on the same row, but with a smaller y value.

✔ Right

Another building somewhere on the same row, but with a bigger y value.

✔ Above

Another building on the same column, but with a smaller x value.

✔ Below

Another building on the same column, but with a bigger x value.

It does not matter how far away those buildings are — they can be touching or many cells away.
As long as they are directly left/right/above/below in a straight line.

Your job is simply:

Count how many buildings have all four of these directions covered.

If a building is missing even one direction, it isn’t counted.
