You are given a number n, and you need to count how many triples of numbers
(a, b, c) exist such that:

all three are between 1 and n

and they satisfy the Pythagorean equation:

a² + b² = c²

This is exactly the same rule used for right-angled triangles.

For example:

3² + 4² = 5² → 9 + 16 = 25 ✔️

So (3,4,5) is one valid triple.

Also (4,3,5) is valid because order matters.

So the job is basically:

Try every possible a from 1 to n

Try every possible b from 1 to n

Compute a² + b²

Check if this number is a perfect square (meaning there is a c whose square equals that number)

Make sure that c ≤ n

If yes → count it

That's it.
