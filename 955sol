You compare the strings the same way humans compare words in a dictionary — from left to right. So you examine the columns one by one starting from the first.

At each column, you only compare neighboring strings.

If a column causes any string above to be alphabetically greater than the one below, that column must be deleted, because dictionary order is already broken and cannot be fixed later.

If a column shows that one string is smaller than the next, that pair is now permanently sorted and never needs to be checked again.

If letters are equal, the column doesn’t decide anything yet.

You delete only the columns that break order and keep all others.
The total number of deleted columns is the answer.
