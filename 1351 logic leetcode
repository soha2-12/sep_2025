The logic is to take advantage of the fact that the matrix is already sorted in 
decreasing order both row-wise and column-wise. 
We start from the bottom-left corner of the
matrix because this position helps us decid
quickly whether to move right or up. If the 
current number is negative, then all the numbers 
to its right in the same row will also be
negative, since the row is sorted.
So we count all those negative numbers
at once and move one row up. If the 
current number is not negative, then all
the numbers above it in the same column
will also be non-negative, so we mov
right to search for negative values.
By repeating this process until we go 
out of bounds, we count all negative
numbers without checking every element,
making the solution efficient.
