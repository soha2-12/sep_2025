You pick up one coupon at a time.

First thing you check:
👉 Is this coupon active?
If it’s expired or turned off, you don’t even look at it again. Straight reject.

Next, you look at where it belongs.
The coupon must be for electronics, grocery, pharmacy, or restaurant.
If it’s for anything else, you say: “Nope, we don’t accept this category.”

Then you look at the coupon code itself.
It should look clean and professional:

Not empty

No weird symbols

Only letters, numbers, or _

If the code looks messy or blank, you throw it away.

Now, after checking all coupons, you’re left with only the good ones.

But you’re not done yet.

You arrange them nicely:

First put electronics coupons

Then grocery

Then pharmacy

Then restaurant

Inside each group, you sort them alphabetically, like how names are arranged in a list.

Finally, you write down only the coupon codes and hand over the list.
