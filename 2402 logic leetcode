Qustion:
You are managing n meeting rooms, each with a unique number starting from 0.
You are also given a list of meetings, each with a start time and end time.

Your job is to:

Assign every meeting to one room

Always follow strict rules while assigning rooms

Finally, figure out which room was used the most

-> Rules you must follow

Meetings are handled in time order
Earlier meetings must be scheduled before later ones.

If a room is free at the meeting’s start time
→ assign the meeting to the lowest-numbered available room.

If all rooms are busy
→ the meeting must wait until the earliest room becomes free
→ once free, the meeting starts immediately and keeps its original duration.

Track usage
→ count how many meetings each room handles.

Final answer
→ return the room with the maximum number of meetings
→ if there’s a tie, choose the room with the smaller number.

--> How to think about the logic (intuitively)

Imagine two lists in your head:

1️1  Free rooms

Rooms that are currently empty

Always pick the smallest room number first

2️2 Busy rooms

Rooms that are occupied

You care about which room finishes earliest

33 What happens for each meeting

First, free up rooms whose meetings have already ended.

Then:

If at least one room is free
→ assign the meeting immediately.

If no room is free
→ delay the meeting until the earliest room finishes.

Every time a room is used, increase its count.

This guarantees:

Fair room usage

Correct handling of delays

Exact tracking of room popularity

--> Final outcome

After all meetings are scheduled:

Look at how many meetings each room handled

Return the room with the highest count

If counts match, the smaller room number wins
